								I was born and raised in the state of Maine, where I still reside to this day.

								When I was sixteen years old, I found a passion for software engineering through an Interactive Media class, which I took at my local vocational school.

									This is a reel showcasing many of the video game projects that I have worked on. The majority of these games were made with the Unity engine and programmed with Unity's C# API. As you will see, many of these where team projects involving multiple members. Aside from the fact that I got a lot of experience working with teams, I particularly enjoyed these projects because they gave me the opportunity to learn about other areas of digital design. For example: in many of these projects I was able to work on the 3D models used.

								<portfolio-item image="assets/photos/IAM-webpage-portfolio-icon.png" title="Inspiration Aviation Ministries">
									This is a webpage that I maintain for a non-profit called Inspiration Aviation Ministries. The front end code for this page was done from scratch (HTML, CSS, JS), and the back end is running on a PHP/MySQL stack. This was the first webpage that I ever published, and I have learned a lot since then. You can visit this webpage at: <a href="http://inspirationaviation.org/" target="_blank">http://inspirationaviation.org/</a>

								<portfolio-item image="assets/photos/youtube-scrubbing-rate-controller-icon.png" title="YouTube Scrubbing Rate Controller" github="https://github.com/idbart/YouTube_Scrubbing_Rate_Controller">
									Traditionally, when watching a YouTube video, the user can press either of the arrow keys to skip 5 seconds of the video in either direction. This is a Chrome extension that I wrote to control the scrubbing rate on YouTube when pressing the arrow keys. With this extension, the user is no longer limited to scrubbing through a video 5 seconds at a time but rather they can choose from a variety of speeds. This extension is a bit niche, and I decided to build it mostly for myself. I hope that someday YouTube will make this a built-in feature. This extension is live on the chrome web store and can be accessed through <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtube-scrubbing-rate-co/mbigoenlkbemdkkjhdpmcbkejihhjbnh" target="_blank">this</a> link.

								<portfolio-item image="assets/photos/passwordgen-portfolio-icon.png" title="Password Generator" downloads="PasswordGenerator.zip" github="https://github.com/idbart/Password_Generator">
									This is a fun little project that I wrote for the .NET Framework in C#. The program is simply a console applicaton that generates a pseudo-random password when given a keyword. I say pseudo-random because the application does not simply give you back a mess of completely random characters, but rather, a compilation of real words strung together after some manipulation. The keyword given will be used as one of the words in the password 100% of the time.

								<portfolio-item image="assets/photos/APECA-portfolio-icon.png" title="APECA" downloads="APECA.zip" github="https://github.com/idbart/APECA">
									APECA literally means "A Private Encrypted Chat Application." APECA runs on a client-server model with completely end-to-end encryption. All messages between clients are encrypted with 128bit AES (with CBC), and the key must be input manually by each user. The encryption key is never transmitted over the network, and the server never has the key. I made this desktop application with C#/.NET primarily because I wanted to learn about the encryption libraries available in the .NET Framework. This project also gave me the opportunity to learn a lot about low-level networking and process threading.

								<portfolio-item image="assets/photos/Init-icon.png" title="Init" downloads="Init.zip" github="https://github.com/idbart/Init">
									Init is a project templating application. I made this application with C#/.NET because I often found myself laying out exactly the same files at the start of every project. Init is an elegant and simple solution to this issue. This application allows the user to make templates (which are just normal file directories) and then init new projects based on those templates.

								<portfolio-item image="assets/photos/thumbnailer-portfolio-icon.png" title="thumbnailer.py" downloads="thumbnailer.py" github="https://github.com/idbart/thumbnailer.py">
									This is a Python script that I wrote for generating photograph thumbnails. This script will loop through all of the photographs in a specified folder and generate thumbnails for them based on a max size (which is also specified by the user). I wrote this script to help automate the maintenance of certain webpages.
